        <summary>What is HTML?</summary>
        <p>
          ðŸ“• HTML is a standard markup language used to create web pages. It's the backbone of a web page, and it's used to define
          the structure and content of a web page. HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, and it's used in
          conjunction with CSS and JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It's the foundation of the web, and
          it's used by web developers to create web pages, web applications, and mobile applications. HTML is constantly evolving,
          with new features and elements being added all the time.

        <summary>What is CSS?</summary>
        <p>
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to control the layout and appearance of web pages. It's used
          to separate the presentation of a document from its structure, making it easier to maintain and update the layout and
          design of a website.
          CSS is a versatile language that can be used to control everything from the color and font of text to the layout and
          spacing of images and other elements on a web page. It's also used to create responsive designs that adapt to different
          screen sizes and devices.
          CSS is typically used in conjunction with HTML and JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It's an
          essential tool for web developers, and it's used to create everything from simple websites to complex web applications.
          CSS is constantly evolving, with new features and selectors being added all the time. It's a powerful language that can
          be used to create a wide range of effects and designs, from simple and elegant to complex and interactive.

        <summary>What is JavaScript?</summary>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language that is used for client-side scripting on the web. It's a
          versatile language that can be used for a wide range of tasks, from creating interactive web pages to developing complex
          web applications.
          JavaScript is used to add interactivity to web pages, allowing users to interact with the page in a more dynamic way.
          It's also used to create dynamic content, such as animations, videos, and audio files.
          JavaScript is a powerful language that can be used to create complex web applications, including games, simulations, and
          multimedia presentations. It's also used to create server-side applications, such as Node.js, which allows developers to
          create scalable and high-performance server-side applications.
          JavaScript is constantly evolving, with new features and libraries being added all the time. It's a popular language
          that's widely used by web developers, and it's a crucial tool for creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
